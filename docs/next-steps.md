# What's left: status at 2026-10-15

A handoff for the next session. The [progress tracker](execution-plan.md#progress-tracker) remains the source of truth for task order; this page says what blocks what right now.

## Where things stand

- **Build:** Phase 0 is complete. Phase 1 tasks 1.1–1.4; Phase 2 tasks 2.1–2.3; Phase 3 tasks 3.1 and 3.5a. 836 tests pass; ruff and mypy clean.
- **0.4 review: closed** (sessions on 2026-10-10, 10-13 and 10-15). Every decision is in README §16 as **#113–128**, and the plan tasks carry the follow-ups. The record of what was decided and why is [spikes/review-agenda.md](spikes/review-agenda.md).
- **Spikes:** all done. 0.3b finished on Thu 2026-10-15: GO on OTO with adjustments ([spikes/alpaca-orders.md](spikes/alpaca-orders.md)). The dev paper account was flattened: no positions, no orders, $4,872.94 equity (the drop is mostly DXJ's false split loss).
- **Accounts:** both Alpaca paper accounts are active (`dev` ...JG3C in `.env`, `paper` ...CDFD in `.env.paper`); the Neon `dev` database is migrated to head (0004).
- **Open PRs:** none. `main` has everything through task 1.3 (PR #25).

## 1. Things only you can do (before task 1.8, not urgent)

- **AWS account:** root MFA, an admin user via IAM Identity Center, budget alarms at $10 / $25.
- **AWS CLI** installed on this PC (Node and the GitHub CLI are already there).
- **healthchecks.io** free account, for the external dead-man's switch.
- **Anthropic Console:** confirm a monthly spend limit is set (about $20 now, about $40 from 4.6).
- **Domain** for the public site: optional.

## 2. The build continues in plan order

Next unticked tasks: **1.5** ingest → **1.6** backfill + real-data smoke run → **1.7** walking skeleton + fake broker and automated chaos tests → **1.8** AWS deploy (needs your OK: it creates AWS resources) → **2.4** regime backtest → **3.2a** onward.

The 0.4 follow-ups are in those tasks now: the T−1 re-fetch, outlier filter, listing dates and batched calendar sync (1.5), 8-K + headline earnings timing (1.6), the OTO/leg/partial-fill order core and the fake broker's 0.3b behaviours (1.7), whole-share sizing (3.5b, 3.6, 3.8).

## How to resume in a new chat

- "start task 1.5".
